# Smart-Video-Surveillance
This project aims to enhance security surveillance systems using computer vision techniques. Traditional security surveillance systems are often limited by human attention and can miss crucial events or activities, leading to potential security breaches. By leveraging computer vision, we can automate the process of monitoring and analyzing video feeds, thereby reducing the risk of security incidents.

# Problem Statement
The security surveillance industry faces challenges in improving the accuracy, efficiency, and scalability of security systems. Traditional systems rely on manual monitoring, which can lead to blind spots and missed events. Additionally, human operators may suffer from fatigue or distractions, reducing the effectiveness of the surveillance system.

#Solution
Utilizing computer vision techniques, we can automate the process of monitoring and analyzing video feeds. By employing advanced algorithms, the system can detect unusual behavior patterns or events, such as unauthorized access, theft, or vandalism. This allows security personnel to quickly identify and respond to potential threats, thereby reducing the risk of security breaches and incidents.

#Features
Object Detection: Detect and track objects of interest in the video stream, such as people, vehicles, and items.
Activity Recognition: Recognize various activities and behaviors, such as running, walking, loitering, or suspicious behavior.
Anomaly Detection: Identify unusual or suspicious events that deviate from normal patterns, alerting security personnel.
Real-time Alerts: Provide instant notifications for detected events, enabling prompt response and action.
Scalability: Handle video feeds from multiple cameras simultaneously, suitable for large-scale surveillance deployments.
Customization: Fine-tune detection models, adjust sensitivity thresholds, and define specific regions of interest.
Integration: Easily integrate with existing surveillance systems or IoT platforms for seamless deployment and management.
